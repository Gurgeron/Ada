Feature Documentation: Insights Dashboard
Overview
The Insights Dashboard provides a high-level overview of key insights from uploaded feature request data. It visualizes trends, identifies patterns, and highlights critical pain points, giving Product Managers actionable information at a glance.

Purpose
Quick Summary: Allow users to see essential insights immediately after uploading data.
Data-Driven Decisions: Highlight the most important trends, pain points, and user engagement metrics to support prioritization.
Visualization: Use visual elements (e.g., cards, charts) to enhance understanding of data.
Key Functionalities
1. Insights Overview
What It Shows:
Most requested features.
Most painful areas (themes from feature requests).
Most engaged customers (highest number of requests).
How Itâ€™s Displayed:
Cards summarizing key insights, with concise text and metrics.
2. Visualized Metrics
Additional Insights:
Requests distribution by category (e.g., UI/UX, Performance, Integrations).
Trends over time (e.g., number of requests by month).
Requests by customer type (e.g., Enterprise, SMB).
Visuals Used:
Pie charts, bar graphs, or line charts for clarity.
3. Modular Design for Expandability
Future Additions:
Filters to customize views (e.g., by customer type or time range).
Drill-down functionality to explore detailed data (e.g., clicking a trend to see all related requests).
Export insights (e.g., PDF or CSV report generation).
User Experience (UX)
1. Layout
Structure:

The dashboard is divided into three sections:
Top Row (Key Metrics): Cards for most common requests, top pain points, and engaged customers.
Middle Row (Visuals): Graphs and charts summarizing trends and distributions.
Bottom Row (Focused Metrics): Lists or detailed stats, such as emerging themes or priority scores.
Example Layout:

css
Copy code
[ Most Common Requests ]   [ Top Pain Points ]   [ Most Engaged Customers ]

       [ Requests by Category (Pie Chart) ]      [ Trends Over Time (Line Chart) ]

      [ Requests by Customer Type ]         [ Average Priority Score ]
2. Visual Design
Card Styling:

Background: #FFFFFF (White).
Border: #D4D4D4 (Light Gray) with hover effect darkening to #B0B0B0.
Header Text: Bold, #3D7269 (Darker Teal).
Body Text: Simple black text.
Charts and Graphs:

Accent colors for chart elements:
Teal (#3D7269) for primary data.
Muted colors for secondary data (e.g., light gray).
Backend Integration
Endpoints
/fetch-insights:

Retrieves processed insights from the backend for the dashboard.

  ]
}
/generate-chart (Optional):

Generates chart images server-side based on insights.
Accepts parameters like chart type and dataset.
Data Sources
Wizard Context: Used for tailoring insights to product goals and user personas.
Uploaded Data: Parsed and processed to extract key insights (e.g., clustering pain points).
Frontend Implementation
Technologies
Framework: React.js for modular UI components.
Charting Library: Chart.js or Plotly for creating graphs and visualizations.
Components
Insight Cards: Reusable React components for displaying metrics (e.g., Most Common Requests).
Chart Components: Modular React components for visualizations, configurable by dataset and chart type.
Dashboard Layout: A grid-based layout wrapping all cards and charts.
Development Notes
Modularity:

Each card and chart is an independent component, allowing easy updates or additions.
API Integration:

Ensure the frontend dynamically fetches insights via /fetch-insights.
Use a fallback state to handle cases where data is unavailable.
Performance:

Cache frequently accessed insights to reduce API calls.
Responsiveness:

Ensure the dashboard layout adjusts for mobile and tablet devices.
