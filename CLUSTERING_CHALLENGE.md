# Ada Feature Request Clustering Challenge

## Context
We're building Ada, an AI-powered feature request analysis tool. The system processes feature requests from CSV files and uses AI to provide actionable insights. A key component is the clustering system that groups similar feature requests together to identify patterns and priorities. The clustering must effectively combine both title and description information to create meaningful groups.

## Current Architecture

### Frontend (React)
- `Dashboard.js`: Main visualization component
- `InsightCard.js`: Displays individual insight cards (Most Common Requests, Top Pain Points)
- `ClusterInsights.js`: Shows detailed cluster analysis with charts

### Backend (Python/Flask)
- `feature_analyzer.py`: Core analysis logic
- `clustering_service.py`: Handles feature request clustering
- `embeddings_service.py`: Generates embeddings using OpenAI
- Data flow: CSV → Title & Description Embeddings → Combined Semantic Analysis → Clusters → Analysis → Frontend

## Current Implementation
1. Feature Request Structure:
   - Feature Title (Short, concise request summary)
   - Description (Detailed explanation of the request)
   - Priority (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
   - Status
   - Customer Type
   - Business Value
   - Customer Impact

2. Current clustering approach:
   - Generate separate embeddings for titles and descriptions
   - Attempt to combine these embeddings (current pain point)
   - Use scikit-learn for clustering
   - Calculate cluster themes and priorities
   - Identify pain points within clusters

## The Challenge
We're experiencing several issues with our clustering implementation:

1. Title-Description Integration Problem:
   - Need to effectively combine title and description semantics
   - Titles are concise but may miss context
   - Descriptions are detailed but may contain noise
   - Current approach doesn't properly balance both sources

2. Empty Cards Problem:
   - Most Common Requests and Top Pain Points cards sometimes appear empty
   - Data seems to be lost between backend processing and frontend display
   - Inconsistent data structure between backend and frontend

3. Clustering Quality:
   - Similar features sometimes end up in different clusters despite similar titles/descriptions
   - Cluster themes don't capture both title and description insights
   - Priority calculations within clusters need refinement

4. Performance Issues:
   - Slow processing with larger datasets
   - Caching system not properly invalidating
   - Memory usage concerns with dual embeddings

## Technical Details

### Current Data Flow:
```python
def analyze_features(self, features):
    # Convert to DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(features)
    
    # Need to generate and combine embeddings for both titles and descriptions
    embedded_data = self.embeddings_service.embed_features(features)
    # Currently not properly handling title and description combination
    
    # Perform clustering on combined embeddings
    cluster_results = self.clustering_service.cluster_features(
        embedded_data['embedded_features']
    )
    
    # Analyze pain points
    pain_points = self._analyze_pain_points(df, cluster_results['clusters'])
    
    return {
        'most_common_requests': self._get_common_requests(cluster_results),
        'top_pain_points': pain_points,
        # ... other insights
    }
```

### Expected Frontend Format:
```javascript
{
  most_common_requests: [
    { name: string, count: number },  // name should reflect both title and description insights
    // ...
  ],
  top_pain_points: [
    { name: string, percentage: number },  // name should capture full context
    // ...
  ]
}
```

## Goals
1. Implement effective title and description combination:
   - Properly weight title vs description importance
   - Capture both concise and detailed information
   - Maintain semantic relationships between both fields

2. Fix the empty cards issue by ensuring proper data flow

3. Improve clustering quality:
   - Better semantic understanding of combined title and description
   - More accurate theme generation reflecting both fields
   - Refined priority calculations

4. Optimize performance:
   - Efficient embedding generation for both fields
   - Smart caching strategy
   - Reduced memory footprint

## Questions to Consider
1. What's the optimal way to combine title and description embeddings?
2. How should we weight the importance of titles versus descriptions?
3. What's the best way to ensure data consistency between backend and frontend?
4. How can we make the clustering more accurate while maintaining performance?
5. What caching strategy would work best for our dual-field approach?

## Additional Context
- Using OpenAI's embeddings API
- Dataset size: 100-1000 feature requests
- Need to maintain real-time performance
- Must handle various title and description formats
- Should scale with growing datasets
- Titles are typically 5-15 words
- Descriptions range from 20-200 words

## Success Criteria
1. Clusters that properly reflect both title and description semantics
2. No empty cards in the dashboard
3. Response time under 2 seconds for typical datasets
4. Accurate priority insights that match manual analysis
5. Stable performance with larger datasets
6. Intuitive groupings that make sense to product managers
